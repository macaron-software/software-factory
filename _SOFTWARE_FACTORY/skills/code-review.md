# Code Review Excellence

This skill enables the agent to perform thorough, constructive code reviews that catch
real issues while maintaining a positive, collaborative tone.

## Use this skill when

- Reviewing pull requests or merge requests
- Evaluating code quality of a file or module
- Checking for security vulnerabilities in code
- Assessing test coverage of changes
- Reviewing architecture decisions in code

## Do not use this skill when

- Writing code from scratch (use TDD or implementation skills)
- Doing security-only audits (use security-audit)
- Reviewing infrastructure/deployment (use devops-pipeline)

## Instructions

### Review Priorities (in order)

1. **Correctness** — Does it work? Edge cases? Race conditions?
2. **Security** — Injection, auth bypass, data exposure, secrets?
3. **Performance** — N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks?
4. **Maintainability** — Readable? Well-named? Single responsibility?
5. **Testing** — Are changes tested? Coverage sufficient?

### Severity Classification

| Level | Label | Meaning | Action Required |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 🔴 | **Blocking** | Bug, security issue, data loss risk | Must fix before merge |
| 🟠 | **Important** | Performance issue, missing test, poor pattern | Should fix before merge |
| 🟡 | **Suggestion** | Better approach exists, minor improvement | Consider for this or next PR |
| 🔵 | **Nit** | Style, naming, minor readability | Optional, low priority |
| 💬 | **Question** | Clarification needed | Answer before merge |

### Review Checklist

#### Correctness
```
- [ ] Logic handles all expected inputs correctly
- [ ] Edge cases covered (null, empty, boundary values)
- [ ] Error paths handled gracefully
- [ ] Async operations have proper error handling
- [ ] State changes are atomic/consistent
- [ ] No off-by-one errors in loops/slices
```

#### Security
```
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords
- [ ] User input is validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] HTML output is escaped (XSS prevention)
- [ ] Authentication checked on protected routes
- [ ] Authorization verified (not just authentication)
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged or exposed in errors
```

#### Performance
```
- [ ] No N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Large lists are paginated
- [ ] Expensive computations are cached when appropriate
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (React: memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Database queries use appropriate indexes
- [ ] File/network operations are properly streamed for large data
```

#### Testing
```
- [ ] New code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Error paths are tested
- [ ] Mocks are appropriate (not over-mocking)
- [ ] Test names describe behavior, not implementation
- [ ] No flaky test patterns (timeouts, shared state)
```

### Feedback Patterns

#### Constructive Comment Template

```
🔴 **Blocking: SQL Injection Risk**

The query concatenates user input directly:
` `
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '${name}'`;
` `

This is vulnerable to SQL injection. Use parameterized queries:
` `
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = $1';
const result = await db.query(query, [name]);
` `
```

#### Asking Questions (Not Demanding)

```
💬 **Question**: I see this fetches all users then filters in memory.
Was there a reason not to filter in the database query?
If not, moving the filter to SQL would reduce memory usage significantly
for large user sets.
```

#### Positive Feedback

```
✅ **Nice**: Clean use of the Strategy pattern here — makes it easy
to add new payment providers without modifying existing code.
```

### Common Issues to Watch For

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
```typescript
// 🔴 Missing await
async function saveUser(user: User) {
  db.save(user); // Missing await — error won't be caught
}

// 🟠 Type assertion hiding bugs
const user = data as User; // Use type guard instead
function isUser(data: unknown): data is User {
  return typeof data === 'object' && data !== null && 'email' in data;
}

// 🟡 Unnecessary re-render
function UserList({ users }: Props) {
  const sorted = users.sort(); // Mutates prop! Use [...users].sort()
  return <div>{sorted.map(u => <User key={u.id} user={u} />)}</div>;
}
```

#### Python
```python
# 🔴 Mutable default argument
def add_item(item, items=[]):  # BAD: shared mutable default
    items.append(item)
    return items

# ✅ Fix
def add_item(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items

# 🟠 Broad exception catching
try:
    process_data()
except Exception:  # Too broad — catches KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit
    pass

# ✅ Fix
try:
    process_data()
except (ValueError, KeyError) as e:
    logger.error(f"Data processing failed: {e}")
```

#### SQL
```sql
-- 🔴 No LIMIT on potentially large result set
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- ✅ Fix
SELECT * FROM logs WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01' LIMIT 1000;

-- 🟠 SELECT * in production code
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1;

-- ✅ Fix: Select only needed columns
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = $1;
```

### PR Review Workflow

1. **Read the PR description** — understand intent before reading code
2. **Check the tests first** — tests tell you what the code should do
3. **Review file by file** — focus on changed lines + surrounding context
4. **Check for missing changes** — are there files that SHOULD have changed but didn't?
5. **Run the code mentally** — trace through the logic with sample inputs
6. **Write constructive feedback** — suggest solutions, not just problems

## Output Format

```
## Code Review: [PR Title / File Name]

### Summary
[1-2 sentence overview of the changes and overall quality]

### Findings
| # | Severity | Category | File:Line | Description |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 Blocking | Security | auth.ts:42 | SQL injection in login query |
| 2 | 🟠 Important | Testing | - | No tests for error handling |
| 3 | 🟡 Suggestion | Performance | api.ts:15 | Consider caching this query |

## Anti-patterns

- **NEVER** just say "this is wrong" without explaining why and suggesting a fix
- **NEVER** bikeshed on style when there are real bugs to find
- **NEVER** approve without actually reading the code
- **NEVER** block on personal preferences — only block on real issues
- **NEVER** review more than 400 lines in one session without a break
- **NEVER** forget to check that tests exist for new/changed code
- **NEVER** ignore the PR description — context matters
- **NEVER** leave ambiguous comments — be specific about file, line, and fix
