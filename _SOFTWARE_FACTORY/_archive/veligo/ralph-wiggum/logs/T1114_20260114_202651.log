<think>
The output is still truncated. Let me try to get the complete file in a different way.
</think>

```bash
wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me try to read the file with a different approach - getting more lines at once.
</think>

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs | head -400</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me try to get the full content of the adapter.rs file. The previous command only showed the first part. Let me try different approaches.
</think>

```bash
head -500 veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The cat/head commands are timing out. Let me try a different approach - maybe the file is large and taking time. Let me try tail instead.
</think>

```bash
wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs && tail -100 veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The terminal is having issues. Let me try a simpler approach to read the files.
</think>

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs</bash>
