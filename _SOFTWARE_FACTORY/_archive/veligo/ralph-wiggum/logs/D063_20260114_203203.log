The user wants me to execute STEP 1 now - checking if the veligo CLI is available by running `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

The veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Proceeding with STEP 2 - running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The veligo cicd pipeline command seems to be showing git status (untracked files) rather than running a deployment. This doesn't look like a successful deployment. Let me continue with STEP 3 - run the tests manually to see if they pass.
</think>

The pipeline command showed git status. Proceeding with STEP 3 - running tests manually:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
