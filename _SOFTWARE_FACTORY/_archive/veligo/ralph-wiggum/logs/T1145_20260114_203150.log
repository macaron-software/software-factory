<think>
The file was cut off. Let me read the full file and also look for the test files.
</think>

```bash
cat ./veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs 2>/dev/null || cat ./backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs 2>/dev/null || find . -name "payment_adapter_factory.rs" -exec cat {} \;</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The output was cut off. Let me try a different approach to see the full file.
</think>

```bash
head -200 ./veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The bash command is getting cut off. Let me try a different approach to see the file.
</think>

```bash
ls -la ./veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user is asking me to perform actions but I'm having trouble getting the bash commands to work properly. Let me try a different approach - I'll just output the bash command properly formatted.
</think>

```bash
ls -la ./veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/</bash>
