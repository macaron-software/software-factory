Good, STEP 1 passed - veligo is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - Run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Proceeding with STEP 2 - Running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The veligo cicd pipeline command ran but showed git status-like output about modified files. This seems to be the pipeline output. I should proceed with STEP 3 to run tests manually since the pipeline may have just shown status.

Actually, looking at the output, this looks like `git status` output rather than a CI/CD pipeline run. The veligo cicd pipeline command might just be showing modified files. Let me continue with the task and run STEP 3 to run tests manually.
</think>

Pipeline status shown. Proceeding with STEP 3 - Running tests manually:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK

> veligo-frontend@0.0.1 test:e2e
> playwright test --project=e2e --reporter=list

Error: Cannot find module '/Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/veligo-platform/frontend/tests/e2e/modules/fixtures' imported from /Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/veligo-platform/frontend/tests/e2e/modules/open-data-api.spec.ts

The test failed because it cannot find a module. This is a test infrastructure issue - a missing fixtures file. The deployment pipeline showed modified files but the test execution is failing due to a missing module.

I should proceed with STEP 4 to validate production health, but given the test failure, I need to assess the overall status. Let me run the health check to see if the application itself is working, even if tests are failing.

The rules say:
- Output SUCCESS only after health check passes
- Output NEEDS_MORE_WORK if any command fails

Let me run the health check.
</think>

Tests failed due to missing module. Proceeding with STEP 4 - Validating production health:

```bash
curl -sf https://veligo.app/api/health && echo "HEALTH OK"
```
