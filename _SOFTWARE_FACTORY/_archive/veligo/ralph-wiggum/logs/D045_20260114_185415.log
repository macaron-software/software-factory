The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately: running the command `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, the veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - Run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI is found. Continuing with STEP 2 - Running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The output shows some modified files but doesn't show a clear success/failure of the deployment pipeline. The veligo cicd pipeline command seems to have run but showed git status information instead of deployment results. Let me continue with STEP 3 and STEP 4 to validate the deployment.
</think>

The pipeline command ran but showed git modifications. Continuing with STEP 3 - Running tests:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
