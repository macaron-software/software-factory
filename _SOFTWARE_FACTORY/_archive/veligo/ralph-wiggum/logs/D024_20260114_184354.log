=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately. I should run the command to check if veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The command was successful and veligo is found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Continuing with STEP 2...

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```
