RESULT: FAILED

ibute is present
2. cat of the specific lines shows the attribute is present
3. git diff shows no changes needed

I should output SUCCESS since the task is complete. But the user keeps saying "no file changes" - maybe they expect me to somehow demonstrate the change even though it's already there?

Actually, let me re-read the task more carefully. The task says:
"Add missing data-testid="station-popup" to StationMap"

So this implies the attribute was MISSING and needs to be ADDED. But our investigation shows it's already there. This could mean:
1. The attribute was added in a previous session
2. The task description was incorrect about it being "missing"
3. The task was already completed

In any case, the current state of the file already has the required attribute. There's no need to make any edits.

I should just confirm the task is complete with SUCCESS.

I've thoroughly investigated the file and confirmed that the `data-testid="station-popup"` attribute is **already present** in `StationMapGeneric.svelte` at line 171. 

Since the required change

<think>
The user is insisting that I make actual changes. Let me re-read the task more carefully.

Looking at the task again:
- Task T149: Add selector station-popup
- File to modify: veligo-platform/frontend/src/lib/components/maps/StationMapGeneric.svelte
- Change Required: Find the appropriate element and add: data-testid="station-popup"

But when I checked, the attribute is already there. The grep output shows:
```
171:			<div class="station-popup" data-testid="station-popup" style="min-width: 200px; font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;">
```

So the change is already done. The user's system is saying "SUCCESS but made no file changes" because there's nothing to change.

I think what might be happening is that maybe the task was already done in a previous session, or the file was already modified before I started. Either way, the result is the same - the data-testid attribute is present.

I should explain this clearly to the user - that the attribute is already in the file and no edit is needed because the task is already complete.
</think>

I understand the confusion. Let me be very clear:

The `data-testid="station-popup"` attribute **already exists** in the file at line 171. When I checked:

```
171:			<div class="station-popup" data-testid="station-popup" style="min-width: 200px; font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;">
```

This is the correct implementation of the task. The task requirement has been satisfied - the selector is present on the correct element.

Since the attribute is already there, attempting to edit with the same old/new text will fail (as I demonstrated), and there are no other locations in the file that need this attribute.

**Task T149 is complete** - the selector `data-testid="station-popup"` is properly added to the station-popup div in StationMapGeneric.svelte.
<bash>echo "TASK COMPLETE: data-testid='station-popup' exists at line 171"</bash>
