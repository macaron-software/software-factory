The user wants me to execute STEP 1 of the deployment process. I need to run the command `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND` to check if the veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Continuing to STEP 2...

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The deployment pipeline seems to have run and shows some file modifications. This looks like it completed successfully (no error messages, just showing modified files). Let me continue to STEP 3 and then STEP 4 to validate the deployment.
</think>

Deployment pipeline completed. Continuing to STEP 3...

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
