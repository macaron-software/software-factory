RESULT: SUCCESS

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to execute STEP 1 of the deployment process. I need to run the command `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The command ran successfully and the output shows:
- OK (exit code)
- /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo (the path where veligo is found)

So veligo CLI IS installed at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. I should continue with STEP 2 now.
</think>

Veligo CLI found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Continuing with STEP 2...

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```
