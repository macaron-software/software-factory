# Plan

1. **Understand the problem**: The task is to fix the `test.skip()` calls in `franceconnect-sso.spec.ts` because they are blocking deployment. According to the success criteria, we need to either implement the skipped tests or remove the skips if they're not needed.

2. **Investigate the file**: I need to examine the content of `tests/e2e/ao-compliance/idfm/franceconnect-sso.spec.ts` to understand what tests are skipped and whether they should be implemented or removed.

3. **Check the context**: Since the file is incomplete in the output, I'll retrieve the full file content and analyze it to determine:
   - What tests are skipped
   - Whether they are essential for compliance
   - If they're placeholders or outdated

4. **Decide on the fix**: Based on analysis, I'll either:
   - Remove `test.skip()` calls if the tests are not needed or are outdated
   - Implement the skipped tests if they're critical for compliance

5. **Verify changes**: After making changes, I'll run the E2E tests to ensure everything passes.

Let me first retrieve the full content of the file.
```bash
cat tests/e2e/ao-compliance/idfm/franceconnect-sso.spec.ts
```

=== LLM Response ===
I apologize for the error. Let me properly analyze and implement the fix.

First, let me retrieve the full content of the file to understand what tests are skipped:
```bash
cat tests/e2e/ao-compliance/idfm/franceconnect-sso.spec.ts
```
