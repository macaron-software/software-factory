Let me analyze this task:

1. **Task**: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/src/payment/factory.rs
2. **Priority**: P1
3. **Queue**: TDD
4. **Parent**: T1048

The task mentions:
- Requires unit tests for StripeProcessor across multiple files
- Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory
- Involves dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation
- Exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains

Let me first explore the project structure to understand what files exist and what needs to be tested.

I should:
1. First, explore the backend/src/payment directory to see all relevant files
2. Read the factory.rs file to understand PaymentAdapterFactory
3. Read adapter.rs to understand PaymentAdapter trait
4. Read the processor files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor)
5. Understand the test structure
6. Implement comprehensive unit tests

Let me start by exploring the directory structure.

I'll start by analyzing the task and exploring the relevant files to understand the codebase structure.

## Task Analysis

**Task**: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in `backend/src/payment/factory.rs`

**Complexity**: Medium - touches multiple files in the payment module, involves factory pattern and dependency injection.

**Approach**:
1. Explore the payment module structure
2. Read the factory.rs file to understand PaymentAdapterFactory
3. Read related files (adapter.rs, processors)
4. Check existing test files
5. Implement comprehensive unit tests

Let me start exploring:

```bash
ls -la veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/
```

=== Action Results ===
```
adapter.rs   factory.rs   lib.rs   processors/
```

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/factory.rs
```

=== Action Results ===
```rust
use crate::payment::{
    PaymentAdapter as PaymentAdapterTrait, PaymentError, PaymentProvider, PaymentRequest,
    PaymentResponse, PaymentResult, PaymentStatus, RefundRequest, RefundResponse,
};
use crate::services::{P
