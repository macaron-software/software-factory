The user wants me to execute STEP 1 of the deployment process. I need to run the command `which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"` to check if the veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Continuing with STEP 2 - running deployment pipeline:
```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK

The deployment pipeline is showing pre-flight checks and there are some uncommitted changes in git. The output seems to have been cut off. I should wait for the full output to see if the pipeline completes successfully or fails.
</think>

The pipeline is running with pre-flight checks showing some uncommitted files. Let me wait for the complete output:
```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1
```
