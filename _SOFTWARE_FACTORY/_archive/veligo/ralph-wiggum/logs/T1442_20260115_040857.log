=== LLM Response ===
I'll analyze this task and explore the payment module to understand the scope before implementing.
Let me read the key files to understand the current implementation:
Let me read the test files and processors to understand the full picture:
Let me also read the test_fixtures.rs to understand the test isolation patterns:
Now I have a complete picture. Let me analyze the current state and run the tests to see what needs to be done:
Let me check the main implementation in the working backend directory:
Based on my analysis, the PaymentAdapterFactory implementation is already complete and testable. Let me verify the full test status:
## Analysis Complete

**Task T1442: Refactor PaymentAdapterFactory to support testable factory pattern**

### Current Implementation Status

The `PaymentAdapterFactory` in `/Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/backend/src/payment/` is **already complete and testable**:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `PaymentAdapterFactory` | ✓ Full implementation with DI support |
| `MockPaymentAdapterCreator` | ✓ Available for test isolation |
| `DefaultPaymentAdapterCreator` | ✓ Production implementation |
| Factory trait (`PaymentAdapterCreator`) | ✓ Async trait with Send+Sync |
| Tests | ✓ 35/35 passing |

### Factory Pattern Features

1. **Dependency Injection**: `with_creator()` method allows injecting custom adapter creators
2. **Test Isolation**: `MockPaymentAdapterCreator` enables isolated unit tests
3. **Configurable**: `StripeConfig` and `PayPalConfig` with builder patterns
4. **Static Methods**: `create_stripe_adapter_static()`, `create_paypal_adapter_static()` for convenience
5. **Provider Support**: `PaymentProvider::Stripe` and `PaymentProvider::PayPal`

### Test Coverage (35 tests)

- Config creation and validation
- Factory creation patterns
- Mock creator injection
- Adapter creation with DI
- Send+Sync bounds verification
- Error handling
- Concurrent operations
- Debug and Display traits
