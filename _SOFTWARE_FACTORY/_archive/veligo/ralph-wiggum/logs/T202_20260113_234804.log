<think>
The user keeps saying I made no file changes. Let me verify what's happening. I need to actually see if the file was changed. Let me check the current state of the file and make sure my writes are working properly.

Let me try a different approach - I'll read the file first to see what's there, then make targeted edits.

Let me verify the current state of the file first:
<bash command="cat veligo-platform/backend/src/grpc/services/bike.rs 2>&1 | head -50"/>
<bash command="wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/grpc/services/bike.rs"/>
<bash command="grep -n "delete_bike" veligo-platform/backend/src/grpc/services/bike.rs"/>
<edit file="veligo-platform/backend/src/grpc/services/bike.rs" old="    async fn delete_bike(
