=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately: running `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user is telling me to continue with the task. Step 1 is complete - veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to execute Step 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Proceeding with Step 2 - running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
   M  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1213.status
   A  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1213.timestamp
   M  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1214.status
   A  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1214.timestamp
    M tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1215.status
    M tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1216.status
    M tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T1217.status
   D  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/locks/T1181.lock/pid
   D  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/locks/T1185.lock/pid
   R  tools/ralph-wiggum/status/locks/T1160.lock/pid -> tools/ralph-wiggu

=== LLM Response ===
Deployment pipeline output indicates ongoing changes in status and lock files under `tools/ralph-wiggum/status`. Since the pipeline output is truncated and no final success or error message is visible, we must assume the pipeline may not have completed successfully.

Proceeding to Step 3: Run tests manually to verify functionality.

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
