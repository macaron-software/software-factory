=== LLM Response ===
I'll analyze the task and implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor. Let me start by examining the existing code structure.
I can see there are TWO PayPalProcessor implementations:
1. `backend/src/payment/paypal_processor.rs` - Main implementation with 1193 lines (already has tests)
2. `backend/src/payment/adapters/paypal_processor.rs` - Adapter pattern with 357 lines (already has tests)

Let me check the PaymentError type and verify the tests compile:
The backend compiles. Let me run the PayPal tests specifically:
The PayPalProcessor already has comprehensive tests in both files. Let me check if there's a separate test file in the tests directory:
The tests already exist. Let me verify they compile and run:
All 366 tests pass, including 41 PayPal-specific tests. The unit tests for PayPalProcessor are already implemented and working.

**Summary:**
- Tests exist in: `backend/src/payment/paypal_processor.rs` (embedded tests)
- Additional isolated tests in: `backend/src/payment/tests/paypal_tests.rs`
- Adapter tests in: `backend/src/payment/adapters/paypal_processor.rs`

**Test coverage includes:**
- Processor creation with default/custom config
- Payment processing (various currencies, amounts, statuses)
- Refund processing (full, partial, zero amount)
- Error handling (auth, network, validation, rate limit, insufficient funds)
- Edge cases (unicode descriptions, large amounts, fractional cents)
- Send/Sync trait verification
- Test isolation verification

**Result:** SUCCESS - Tests already implemented and all 366 tests pass.
