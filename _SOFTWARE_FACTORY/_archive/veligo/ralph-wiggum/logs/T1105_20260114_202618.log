============================================================
RESULT: FAILED
============================================================
=== Action Results ===
bash: FAIL
cat: backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs: No such file or directory


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The file doesn't exist at that path. Let me search for it in the project structure.
</think>

<bash_command>
find backend -name "*.rs" | head -50</bash_command>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to use concrete actions with bash or edit tags. Let me use find to locate the payment adapter factory file.
</think>

```bash
find backend -name "*.rs" | head -50
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
backend/src/payment/factory.rs
backend/src/payment/adapter.rs
backend/src/payment/stripe_adapter.rs
backend/src/payment/paypal_processor.rs
backend/src/payment/adapter_factory.rs
backend/src/payment/mod.rs
backend/src/payment/paypal_adapter.rs
backend/src/payment/stripe_processor.rs
backend/src/lib.rs


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Now I can see the file structure. The file I need is `backend/src/payment/adapter_factory.rs` (not `payment_adapter_factory.rs`). Let me read that file along with related files to understand the implementation.
</think>

Now I can see the structure. The factory is in `adapter_factory.rs`. Let me read the relevant files:
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/adapter_factory.rs</bash_command>
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/mod.rs</bash_command>
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash_command>
