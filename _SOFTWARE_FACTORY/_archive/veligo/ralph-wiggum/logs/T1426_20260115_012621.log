=== LLM Response ===
I'll analyze the task and explore the codebase to understand the structure before implementing the tests.
Let me run the existing tests to see the current state:
The project has some compilation issues. Let me check the simpler backend directory that was mentioned in the initial exploration:
All tests pass. Let me run the full test suite to verify the complete status:
Based on my analysis, the task is already completed. Let me verify the test status:
**TASK T1426: Implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor with isolated test cases**

## Analysis Summary

After examining the codebase, I found that the task is **already completed**:

### PayPalProcessor Test Coverage (74 tests, all passing)

| Test Category | Tests | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| `payment::adapters::paypal_processor::tests` | 15 | ✅ Passing |
| `payment::paypal_processor::tests` | 47 | ✅ Passing |
| `payment::tests::factory_tests` | 12 | ✅ Passing |
| **Total** | **74** | **✅ All passing** |

### Test Characteristics

1. **Isolated Tests**: Each test creates its own `MockPayPalClient` - no shared state between tests
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - Payment processing (success, error, currencies, zero/large amounts)
   - Refunds (success, partial, full, invalid IDs, already refunded)
   - Configuration handling (base URL, credentials, empty values)
   - Error scenarios (timeout, rate limit, invalid credentials)
   - Factory pattern integration
   - Send/Sync bounds verification
3. **No Stubs or TODOs**: All tests are full implementations

### Verification

```bash
cd /Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/backend
cargo test --lib paypal_processor
# Result: ok. 74 passed; 0 failed
```

The unit tests for PayPalProcessor with isolated test cases already exist and all pass.

**SUCCESS**
