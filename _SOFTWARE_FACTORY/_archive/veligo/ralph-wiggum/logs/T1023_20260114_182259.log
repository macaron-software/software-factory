<think>
The user is saying that the <write> tags I used didn't actually make any file changes. This is strange because I did use the <write> tags. Let me think about this...

The issue might be that the <write> tags are not actually executing - they might be a visualization format but not actual file operations. The user wants me to use bash commands to write the files and then verify they exist.

Let me use a bash command to write the files and then verify with cat.

I understand now - the `<write>` tags are not actually writing files. Let me use bash commands to write the files and then verify:

```bash
echo 'use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum PaymentError {
    #[error("Invalid amount: {0}")]
    InvalidAmount(i64),
    #[error("Invalid currency: {0}")]
    InvalidCurrency(String),
    #[error("Invalid charge id")]
    InvalidChargeId,
    #[error("Payment processing failed: {0}")]
    ProcessingFailed(String),
}

pub type PaymentResult<T> = Result<T, PaymentError>;

#[async_trait::async_trait]
pub trait PaymentAdapter: Send + Sync {
    async fn process_payment(&self, amount: i64, currency: &str) -> PaymentResult<String>;
    async fn refund_payment(&self, charge_id: &str) -> PaymentResult<String>;
}' > veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter_trait.rs
