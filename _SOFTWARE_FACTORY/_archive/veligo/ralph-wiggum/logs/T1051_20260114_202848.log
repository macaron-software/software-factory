The user wants me to analyze the task first and show a plan before implementing. Let me understand the task:

1. Task T1051: Write integration tests for payment processing flow with Stripe
2. Priority: P1
3. WSJF Score: 8.0
4. Queue: TDD
5. Parent: T1026
6. Generated by: Fractal LLM Delegation

The description says:
- Write integration tests for payment processing flow with Stripe
- Task requires unit tests for StripeProcessor across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files)
- Complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation
- Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files
- Exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains

Success Criteria:
- Task completed
- Tests pass
- No stubs or TODOs

The last failure was trying to find a Shared folder that doesn't exist. Let me first explore the project structure to understand what we're working with.

This looks like a complex task that may require fractal_delegate. Let me start by exploring the backend payment directory to understand the scope.

I'll analyze the task and explore the codebase first. This is a complex integration testing task that likely touches multiple files.

## Task Analysis

**Task**: Write integration tests for payment processing flow with Stripe
**Complexity**: Medium (according to Ralph status)
**Scope**: 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory with complex interactions

Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand the codebase:
<bash>
find /workspace -type f -name "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(payment|stripe)" | head -30</bash>

<bash>
ls -la /workspace 2>/dev/null || echo "Checking for common project directories..."
ls -la ~/sylvain 2>/dev/null | head -20</bash>

ERROR: LLM call failed
