=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me analyze this task. The task is to implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor with dependency injection mocking. This is a Rust backend task related to payment processing.

Let me first understand the scope by exploring the relevant files in the backend/src/payment directory.
</think>

I'll start by analyzing the task. Let me explore the relevant files to understand the scope and complexity.
<bash>
find veligo-platform/backend -type f -name "*.rs" | xargs grep -l -E "(PayPalProcessor|StripeProcessor|PaymentAdapterFactory)" 2>/dev/null | head -20
</bash>

=== Action Results ===

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me explore the relevant files to understand the PayPalProcessor and related components. I need to understand:
1. The structure of PayPalProcessor
2. How dependency injection is used
3. What interfaces/traits are involved
4. What tests already exist

Let me look at the main files.
</think>

<read file="veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapters/paypal.rs"/>
<read file="veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/paypal.rs"/>
<read file="veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs"/>
<read file="veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter.rs"/>

=== LLM Response ===
After analyzing the files, I can see that the task involves implementing unit tests for PayPalProcessor with dependency injection and mocking.

ERROR: LLM call failed
