### Plan

The task is to implement unit tests for `PayPalProcessor` in `backend/src/payment/paypal_processor.rs`. Based on the current state of the file and the description, here's what we know:

- The file `paypal_processor.rs` is partially implemented (as seen in the edit: `pub struct PayPalProcessorConfig { ... }` is incomplete).
- The `PayPalProcessor` likely implements the `PaymentAdapter` trait, as it's part of the payment processing ecosystem.
- We are expected to write **unit tests**, which means isolated, fast tests focusing on
