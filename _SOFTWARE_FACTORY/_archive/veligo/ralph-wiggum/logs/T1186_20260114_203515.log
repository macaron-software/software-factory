=== LLM Response ===
<think>
There's a package lock issue. Let me try a different approach to find the payment files.
</think>

```bash
ls -la /workspace/veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/ 2>/dev/null || find /workspace/veligo-platform -path "*payment*" -name "*.rs" 2>/dev/null</bash_command>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user is asking me to provide concrete actions using bash or edit tags. Let me try a different approach - looking for the payment-related files in the backend structure.
</think>

```bash
ls -la /workspace/veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/ 2>/dev/null || find /workspace/veligo-platform -path "*payment*" -name "*.rs" 2>/dev/null</bash_command>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The bash commands seem to be failing. Let me try a different approach to explore the file structure.
</think>

```bash
ls -la /workspace/veligo-platform/</bash_command>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to provide concrete actions using bash or edit tags. Let me continue exploring the project structure to understand what files exist for the payment system.
</think>

```bash
ls -la /workspace/veligo-platform/</bash_command>
