The user wants me to execute STEP 1 of the deployment process. I need to run the command `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND` to check if the veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, the veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to run STEP 2 - the deployment pipeline.
</think>

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK

The veligo cicd pipeline command seems to have output some git status information about modified files. This doesn't look like a successful deployment pipeline output. Let me run the health check to validate the production status.
</think>

```bash
curl -sf https://veligo.app/api/health && echo "HEALTH OK"
```
