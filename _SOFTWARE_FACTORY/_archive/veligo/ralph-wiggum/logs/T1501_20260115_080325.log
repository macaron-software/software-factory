=== LLM Response ===
### Plan

The task is to **update `payment_repository.rs` to validate input before persistence**. Based on the provided error log and context, we can infer the following:

1. The file `payment_repository.rs` likely contains a `PaymentRecord` or similar struct that needs validation before being persisted.
2. The error shows a partial `validate()` method on `StripeCustomerRecord`, which suggests that validation logic is already being implemented in a similar pattern.
3. The task is **not overly complex**—it involves validating a single struct before persistence, likely using `Result<(), String>` for validation errors.
4. The success criteria emphasize:
   - No stubs or TODOs
   - Tests pass
   - Code is executable

Given this, the

ERROR: LLM call failed
