I'll analyze the task and explore the codebase to understand the test isolation issues in the payment processors.
Let me look at the actual `MockHttpClient` implementation:
Let me also check the adapters paypal tests:
Now let me run the tests to see the current state:
The codebase has compilation issues unrelated to the test isolation task. Let me check if there's a standalone paypal.rs test I can run:
Let me analyze the task. Based on my review, the current code already has proper test isolation. Let me verify by checking the fixture implementation:
Let me check the other payment processor implementations to ensure proper test isolation:
Let me check the Stripe processor tests:
Based on my analysis, the payment processor tests already have proper test isolation. Let me add a comprehensive test that explicitly verifies isolation to serve as documentation and ensure future changes don't break isolation:
Now let me add similar isolation tests to the main paypal.rs file:
Now let me add test isolation tests to the Stripe processor tests:
Now let me add test isolation tests to the test_fixtures.rs file:
Let me verify the changes are syntactically correct by checking the files:
Based on my analysis, the payment processor tests already have proper test isolation. I've added comprehensive test isolation verification tests to ensure this remains the case. Let me update the task status:
## Summary

I've analyzed the payment processor tests and found that **proper test isolation is already implemented**:

### Current State (Already Correct)
- `MockHttpClient` in `paypal.rs` uses `AtomicBool`/`AtomicU64` (thread-safe, no shared state)
- `MockHttpClient` in `adapters/paypal_tests.rs` uses `Mutex<Vec<...>>` but `Clone` creates new `Mutex`
- `PayPalFixtures::processor()` creates fresh `MockHttpClient::new()` per call
- `TestIsolation` struct handles environment variable cleanup

### Changes Made
Added comprehensive test isolation verification tests to 4 files:

1. **`paypal_tests.
