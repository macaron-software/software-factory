The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately - checking if veligo CLI is available by running `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

The user wants me to continue with the deployment task. STEP 1 is complete - veligo CLI was found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Now I need to proceed to STEP 2 and run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Proceeding to STEP 2 - Running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK

The pipeline output got cut off. I need to see more of the output to check if the deployment completed successfully. Let me run the command again or check the tail end.
</think>

The output was truncated. Let me get the final results:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -50
```
