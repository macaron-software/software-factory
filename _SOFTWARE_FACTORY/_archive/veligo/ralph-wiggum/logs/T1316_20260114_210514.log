# Analysis of Task T1316: Implement PaymentAdapterFactory with full test coverage (100%)

## Complexity Assessment
- **Files involved**: Likely 6-8 files (backend/src/payment directory + tests)
- **LOC estimate**: 400+ LOC (based on factory pattern, DI, multiple processor variants, edge cases)
- **Domains touched**: Payment processing, dependency injection, factory pattern, testing
- **Dependencies**: StripeProcessor, PaymentProcessor trait, config, error handling

This exceeds the 400 LOC and 5-file threshold, so **fractal delegation is required**.

## Fractal Delegation Plan

<fractal_delegate reason="Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files across 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.">
  <subtask>Implement PaymentAdapterFactory with core factory logic in backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs</subtask>
  <subtask>Implement StripeProcessor and related error types in backend/src/payment/processors/stripe.rs</subtask>
  <subtask>Implement PaymentProcessor trait and abstract base types in backend/src/payment/mod.rs</subtask>
  <subtask>Write unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory including all factory variations and edge cases in backend/src/payment/tests/payment_adapter_factory
