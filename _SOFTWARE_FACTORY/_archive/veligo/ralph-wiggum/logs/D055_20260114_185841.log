The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately. Let me run the command to check if veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - Run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Continuing with STEP 2...

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The veligo cicd pipeline command showed some git modifications but didn't show a clear pass/fail result for the pipeline. I need to check if this indicates the pipeline ran successfully or if it failed. The output shows modified files but no clear deployment status.

Let me continue with STEP 3 - running tests manually since the pipeline output wasn't clear about success/failure.
</think>

Pipeline status unclear. Running STEP 3 - manual tests:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
