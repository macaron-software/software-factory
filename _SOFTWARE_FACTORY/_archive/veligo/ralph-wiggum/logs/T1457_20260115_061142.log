=== LLM Response ===
I'll analyze the task and start by exploring the codebase to understand the PayPalProcessor implementation and existing patterns.
I see the PayPalProcessor already has comprehensive unit tests with proper dependency injection and mocking. Let me verify if the tests compile and run correctly.
The code compiles. Let me run the PayPal tests specifically:
All 137 PayPal tests pass. The task is already completed - PayPalProcessor has comprehensive unit tests with proper dependency injection and mocking.

Let me verify there are no stubs or TODOs:
**Task T1457 Status: COMPLETE**

The PayPalProcessor already has comprehensive unit tests with proper dependency injection:

**Summary:**
- **137 PayPal tests passing** (all passing)
- **No stubs or TODOs** in test files
- **Proper DI implemented**: `PayPalClientTrait` with `MockPayPalClient`
- **Isolated testing**: Separate `IsolatedMockPayPalClient` in `tests/paypal_tests.rs`

**Test Coverage:**
- Payment processing (success, error, currencies, amounts)
- Capture operations (success, pending, denied)
- Refund operations (full, partial, errors)
- Error handling (auth, network, validation, rate limits)
- Configuration tests (base URL, credentials)
- Send/Sync bounds
- Clone behavior
- Concurrent processing
All 446 payment tests pass. The implementation is complete and verified.

**SUCCESS**
