The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately: run `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`
</think>

```

The veligo CLI is found at /Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.

veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100

The veligo cicd pipeline command seems to have output some git status information about modified files. This doesn't look like a successful deployment pipeline output. Let me check the exit status - the user said "bash: OK" which suggests the command ran but may have had issues.

Since the deployment pipeline didn't seem to work properly, I should proceed to STEP 3 as specified in the instructions - run tests manually.
</think>

The pipeline command returned git modified file information rather than deployment output. Proceeding to STEP 3:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
