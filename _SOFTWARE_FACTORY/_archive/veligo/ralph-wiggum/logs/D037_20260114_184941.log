The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately: run `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND`
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo


=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user wants me to continue with the deployment task. STEP 1 shows that veligo CLI is found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Now I need to proceed to STEP 2 and run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

**STEP 1:** ✅ Veligo CLI found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`

---

**STEP 2:** Running deployment pipeline...

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

bash: OK

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The output from `veligo cicd pipeline` shows some modified files (M flag), but this doesn't look like a proper deployment pipeline output. It seems to be showing git status instead. Let me check if there was more output or if the command failed. 

I should continue with STEP 3 and run the manual tests since this doesn't look like a successful deployment.
</think>

The pipeline output shows modified files (git status). Let me continue with STEP 3 to run manual tests.

**STEP 3:** Running manual tests...

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
