The deployment pipeline command returned some git status-like output showing modified files. This doesn't look like a successful deployment. Let me continue with STEP 3 - running tests manually to validate the build.
</think>

Deployment pipeline shows some status files modified. Continuing with STEP 3 - Running tests manually:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
