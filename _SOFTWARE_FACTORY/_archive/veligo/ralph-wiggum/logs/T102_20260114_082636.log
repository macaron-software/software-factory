### Plan

1. **Understand the issue**:  
   The test file `tcl-multimodal.spec.ts` has a `test.skip()` call at line 58, which is blocking the test from running. Since the task states that `test.skip()` blocks deployment, we must **remove the skip** and ensure the test runs.

2. **Locate the skipped test**:  
   Using the file content provided, we can see the test is defined with `test.skip()` on line 58. We need to:
   - Confirm the test is valid and should be run.
   - Remove the `.skip()` method from the test.

3. **Verify the test logic**:  
   The test appears to be checking for price breakdown and single checkout functionality. The test is already written with proper assertions and logs, so it's safe to enable.

4. **Ensure test runs correctly**:  
   After removing `test.skip()`, we must:
   - Run the E2E test to verify it passes.
   - Ensure no regressions occur.

5. **Output**:  
   If successful, output `SUCCESS`. If any issue arises, output `NEEDS_HELP`.

### Execution

1. **Check the file content around line 58**:

```bash
grep -n "test.skip" tests/e2e/ao-compliance/lyon/tcl-multimodal.spec.ts
```

<edit file="tests/e2e/ao-compliance/lyon/tcl-multimodal.spec.ts" old="  test.skip('AC-008: Price breakdown and checkout', async ({ page }) => {" new="  test('AC-008: Price breakdown and checkout', async ({ page }) => {" />
