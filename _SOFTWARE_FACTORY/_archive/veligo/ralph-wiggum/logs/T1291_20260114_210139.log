<think>
The output was cut off. Let me get the full bike.rs file and also explore the repository structure.

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The output is getting cut off. Let me try a different approach - maybe the file is incomplete or there's an issue. Let me see the full file using a different method.

```bash
wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/bike.rs && head -150 veligo-platform/backend/src/bike.rs
