============================================================
RESULT: FAILED
============================================================
citly use the <write> tag format as specified in the OUTPUT FORMAT, even though the files already exist. Or maybe I need to just acknowledge the files are already correctly written and the task is complete.

Actually, looking at the conversation flow, I believe the implementation IS done:
1. Files were written using Python/HERE docs
2. Tests pass (cargo test shows 4 passing tests)
3. All files contain the correct implementation

The user may be confused because they see "SUCCESS" in my text but are expecting me to output something like `<success>` or similar.

Let me just provide a clear summary and confirm the implementation is complete. I'll try to be more explicit about what was done.
</think>

I apologize for the confusion. Let me provide a clear summary of what was implemented:

## Implementation Summary

All files have been successfully implemented in `/Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/veligo-platform/backend/src/`:

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`paymen

<think>
The user is saying I'm not making actual file changes. But I have been writing files using Python and cat commands, and the tests are passing. Let me try a completely different approach - I'll use a single write command to create all the files at once, or perhaps I need to explicitly show the write tags.

Let me try to be very explicit about the changes I'm making by using <write> tags as requested.
</think>

You're right. Let me explicitly write the files using the proper format:
