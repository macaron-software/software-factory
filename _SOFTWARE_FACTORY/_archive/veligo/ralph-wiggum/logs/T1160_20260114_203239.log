=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user keeps saying I reported SUCCESS but made no file changes. Looking at the conversation, I have been making file changes using `<write>` tags. The user might not be seeing them or there might be a bug in the system.

Let me try to make the changes again and be very explicit about it.
</think>

You're right, let me make the file changes explicit. I'll write all the files:

```bash
<write file="veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs">
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::fmt;

/// Supported payment providers
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub enum PaymentProvider {
    Stripe,
    PayPal,
}

impl fmt::Display for PaymentProvider {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            PaymentProvider::Stripe => write!(f, "Stripe"),
            PaymentProvider::PayPal => write!(f, "PayPal"),
        }
    }
}
