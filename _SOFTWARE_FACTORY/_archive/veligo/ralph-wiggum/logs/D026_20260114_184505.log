The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately. I need to run the command `which veligo || echo NOT FOUND` and report the result.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo NOT FOUND
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, STEP 1 completed. The veligo CLI is found at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Now I need to continue with STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

Veligo CLI found. Continuing with STEP 2 - running deployment pipeline:

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

The deployment pipeline output shows some modified status files but doesn't show a clear success/failure message. I need to see more of the output to determine if the pipeline succeeded. However, I only have the last 100 lines which show status file changes.

Let me continue with STEP 3 and STEP 4 to validate the deployment.
</think>

Pipeline shows status file changes. Continuing with STEP 3 - running tests manually:

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
