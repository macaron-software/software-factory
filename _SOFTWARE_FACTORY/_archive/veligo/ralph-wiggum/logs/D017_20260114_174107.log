### Plan Analysis

The task is to **deploy changes from T180 to production via CI/CD pipeline**, with the following success criteria:
- Veligo CI/CD pipeline passes all stages
- E2E tests pass on staging
- E2E tests pass on production
- No regressions in journey tests

#### Files Changed:
- `tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T180.status`
- `tools/ralph-wiggum/status/T180.timestamp`
- `tools/ralph-wiggum/tasks/T180.md`
- `veligo-templates`

These files are **metadata/status tracking files** used by Ralph Wiggum (internal tooling), not actual code changes. The actual fix is in:
- `station_management_module.rs` — which has a **compilation error** (implied from task description)

But no diff is shown for `station_management_module.rs`, so we must assume the fix is already committed in the branch or PR associated with T180.

#### Complexity Assessment:
- Only **one source file** (`station_management_module.rs`) is implicated in a compilation error.
- The change is likely small (fixing a syntax or type error).
- No

ERROR: LLM call failed
