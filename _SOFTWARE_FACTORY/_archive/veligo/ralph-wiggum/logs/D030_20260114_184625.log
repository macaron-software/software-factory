The user wants me to execute STEP 1 immediately. Let me run the command to check if veligo CLI is available.
</think>

```bash
which veligo || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo

Good, veligo CLI is installed at `/Users/sylvain/.cargo/bin/veligo`. Now I need to execute STEP 2 - run the deployment pipeline.
</think>

```bash
veligo cicd pipeline 2>&1 | tail -100
```

=== Action Results ===

The veligo cicd pipeline command ran and returned some git status output about modified files. This doesn't look like a successful deployment pipeline completion. Let me continue with the remaining steps - running tests and validating health.
</think>

```bash
cd veligo-platform/frontend && npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list 2>&1 | tail -50
```
