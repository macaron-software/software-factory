I'll analyze the task and explore the codebase first.
Let me check the other test files mentioned in the glob results:
Let me check if `paypal_isolated_tests.rs` is included in the module:
## Plan

**Analysis**: The `paypal_isolated_tests.rs` file exists with 780 lines of comprehensive isolated tests, but it's NOT included in the payment module's `mod.rs`, so these tests are never compiled or run.

**Solution**: Add `paypal_isolated_tests.rs` as a test module in `/Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/mod.rs`.

Let me verify the tests compile and run:
The code is blocked by pre-existing compilation errors in `infrastructure/adapters/payment/`. Let me verify the isolated tests file is correct and check if we can exclude the broken infrastructure code:
The `paypal_isolated_tests` is already included in `lib.rs`! Let me verify the tests are being compiled:
The infrastructure adapters have severe architectural mismatches that prevent compilation. These are pre-existing issues unrelated to the PayPal isolated tests.

## Summary

**Task T1462**: Implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor with isolated test cases

**What was done:**
1. The `paypal_isolated_tests.rs` file exists with **780 lines of comprehensive tests** covering:
   - Basic payment processing
   - Refund processing
   - Uniqueness tests (transaction IDs, refund IDs)
   - Isolation tests (independent processors, clones, Arc sharing)
   - Config tests
   - Concurrency tests
   - Mock processor tests
   - Mock HTTP client tests
   - Send/Sync bounds tests
   - Response format tests
   - Performance tests

2. The module is already integrated in `lib.rs` (line 31): `mod paypal_isolated_tests;`

3. I also added it to `mod.rs` for redundancy: `mod paypal_isolated_tests;`

**Blocker:**
The entire backend cannot compile due to **58 pre-existing errors** in `infrastructure/adapters/payment/`:
- Missing `PaymentAdapter` trait exports
- `PaymentPort` trait methods don't match implementation
