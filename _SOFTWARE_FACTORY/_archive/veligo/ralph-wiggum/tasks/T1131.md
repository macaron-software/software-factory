=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Good, I can read files. Let me continue exploring the adapter.rs file and the adapters directory.
</think>

<read>
<path>veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</path>
</read></invoke>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user is asking me to use concrete actions. Let me try using the read action to read the file.

Something is wrong with the bash formatting. Let me try a simpler command.

<bash>
<cmd>ls</cmd>
