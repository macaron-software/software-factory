## Description
Ensure test isolation and dependency injection mocking across all payment-related components

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, PaymentProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, PaymentService) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This spans 5+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, likely exceeding 400 LOC and touching multiple domains.
