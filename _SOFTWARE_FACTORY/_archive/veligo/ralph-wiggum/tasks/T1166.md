# Task T1166: Implement StripeProcessor integration tests with mock Stripe

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1053
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement StripeProcessor integration tests with mock Stripe API

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files across 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
