# Task T1165: Implement PaymentProcessor trait tests with full path covera

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1053
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement PaymentProcessor trait tests with full path coverage

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files across 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me look at the PaymentProcessor trait definition and related files to understand what needs to be tested.
</think>

```bash
cat ./veligo-platform/tenant/backend-api/src/infrastructure/adapters/payment/mod.rs
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
// Payment adapters module
// Test isolation: using mock objects and avoiding shared state

mod factory;
mod mock_adapter;

pub use factory::{PaymentAdapterFactory, PaymentProcessorFactory};
pub use mock_adapter::MockPaymentAdapter;
```
