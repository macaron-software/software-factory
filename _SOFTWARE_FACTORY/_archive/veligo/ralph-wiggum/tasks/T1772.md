## Description
Implement StripeProcessor integration tests using mock Stripe API (part 4: verify dependency injection and factory pattern behavior)

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests across 4+ files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, StripePaymentHandler, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, estimated ~450 LOC across multiple domains.
