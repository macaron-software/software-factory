# Task T1168: Implement PaymentAdapterFactory unit tests with factory patt

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1054
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement PaymentAdapterFactory unit tests with factory pattern validation

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files across 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The issue is with workspace dependencies. Let me try running the tests from the root workspace, but I should run only for the backend package:
</think>

Let me try running tests from the workspace root with specific package:
<bash>
cd veligo-platform && cargo test -p veligo-backend payment_factory_tests 2>&1 | head -80</bash>

=== Action Results ===
