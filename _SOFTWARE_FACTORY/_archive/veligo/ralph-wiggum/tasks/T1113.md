# Task T1113: Add mock implementations for PayPalProcessor and StripeProce

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1042
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Add mock implementations for PayPalProcessor and StripeProcessor in backend/src/payment/mocks.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Now let me look at the existing adapters to understand the trait structures better, and also check if there's already a mocks.rs file:
</think>

<bash>
find veligo-platform/backend/src -name "mocks.rs" 2>/dev/null
</bash>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
```

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::fmt;

pub enum PaymentProvider {
    Stripe,
    PayPal,
}

impl fmt::Display for PaymentProvider {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        match self {
            PaymentProvider::Stripe => write!(f, "Stripe"),
            PaymentProvider::PayPal => write!(f,

Let me try a different approach to see the full adapter.rs file:
</think>

<bash>
tail -150 veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs
</bash>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
use async_trait::async_trait;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use crate::payment::{
    PaymentAdapter as PaymentAdapterTrait, PaymentError, PaymentProvider, PaymentRequest,
    PaymentResponse, PaymentResult, PaymentStatus, RefundRequest, RefundResponse,
};
use super::{PayPalProcessor, PayPalProcessorConfig, StripeProcessor, StripeProcessorConfig};

/// Trait for payment processors - allows for dynamic dispatch and mocking
#[async_trait]
pub trait PaymentAdapter: Send + Sync + Clone + 'static {
