# Task T824: Implement StripeAdapter using stripe-rs with v2 API

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T618
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement StripeAdapter using stripe-rs with v2 API

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+frontend+tests, touching backend infrastructure, API integrations, and test mocking. The complexity exceeds single-agent capacity. However, since delegation failed, we attempt direct implementation with minimal, focused changes.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
