**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor with mock dependency injection

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires test isolation and dependency injection via mocks across 4+ files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, PayPalProcessor) with complex interactions, involving backend/src/payment directory and associated test files. Total LOC estimate exceeds 400, multiple domains (payment processing, factory pattern, DI, mocking), and test coverage required.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
