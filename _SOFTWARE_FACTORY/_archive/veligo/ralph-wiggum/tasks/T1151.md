# Task T1151: Create isolated test environment for payment processing flow

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1051
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Create isolated test environment for payment processing flow

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me continue exploring the codebase to understand the structure better. I need to see the payment_adapter_factory.rs and the lib.rs more carefully, as well as any existing tests.
