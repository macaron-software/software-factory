## Description
Ensure test coverage for error cases and edge conditions across all adapters

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentAdapter implementations across multiple files (likely 4+ files) in backend/src/payment/adapters/, touching multiple domains: payment logic, factory pattern, dependency injection, test isolation, and test coverage. This exceeds 400 LOC and involves coordination across multiple modules.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
