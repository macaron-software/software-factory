**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1378
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock-based test isolation

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires test isolation and dependency injection via mocks across 4+ files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, PayPalProcessor) with complex interactions, involving backend/src/payment directory and associated test files. Total LOC estimate exceeds 400, multiple domains (payment processing, factory pattern, DI, mocking), and test coverage required.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
