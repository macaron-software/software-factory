**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1366
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Ensure test coverage for all payment processor interactions and error paths

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for StripeProcessor in backend/src/payment/processor/stripe_processor.rs, involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, PayPalProcessor), touching more than 5 files and likely exceeding 400 LOC. Requires careful test isolation and mocking of external services like Stripe API.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
