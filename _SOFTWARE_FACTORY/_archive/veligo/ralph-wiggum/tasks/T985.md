**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement integration tests for PaymentProcessor factory pattern with mock dependencies in backend/src/payment

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of integration tests for PaymentProcessor factory pattern across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory), involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This spans 5+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, with complex interactions and test isolation requirements. Exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains (payment processing, factory pattern, testing).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
