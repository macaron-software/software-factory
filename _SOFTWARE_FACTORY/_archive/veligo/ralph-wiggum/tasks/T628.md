**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement PaynumAdapter using HTTP client with v2 API

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of two payment adapters (Paynum + Stripe), factory pattern, and integration tests across multiple files, touching backend infrastructure and testing layers. This spans more than 5 files and involves HTTP clients, API integrations, and test mocking.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

The bash command format seems to be having issues. Let me try a different approach - using the cat command to read files directly.

<invoke><bash>
<command>pwd</command>
 <timeout></timeout>

The project is not in /Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/backend/src. Let me explore the current directory structure.

```bash
ls -la /Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2

Let me try to write a file directly using the <write> tag to create the implementation. But first, I need to understand the project structure.

Looking at the task description:
- Task T628: Implement PaynumAdapter using HTTP client with v2 API
- Parent: T618
- This is about implementing a payment adapter

I should try to explore the existing code by reading files directly.
</think>

Let me try to understand the project structure by reading files directly:
<invoke><write file="check_structure.sh">
#!/bin/bash
ls -la /Users/sylvain/_LAPOSTE/_VELIGO2/
</write></invoke>

=== Action Results ===
write: OK
File written
```
