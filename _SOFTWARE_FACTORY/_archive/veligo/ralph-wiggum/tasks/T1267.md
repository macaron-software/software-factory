# Task T1267: Refactor existing payment service to use factory pattern

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1133
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Refactor existing payment service to use factory pattern

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches multiple domains and exceeds 400 LOC.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
