# Task T1149: Implement integration tests for StripeProcessor with mock St

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1051
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement integration tests for StripeProcessor with mock Stripe API

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
