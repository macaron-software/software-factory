# Task T1041: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/sr

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1022
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
It seems the file content is being truncated. Let me try a different approach to see the full file.
