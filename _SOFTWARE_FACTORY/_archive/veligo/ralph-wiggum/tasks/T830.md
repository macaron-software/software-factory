# Task T830: Implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T826
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentProcessor implementations across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory), likely involving 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains, making it too complex for a single agent.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
