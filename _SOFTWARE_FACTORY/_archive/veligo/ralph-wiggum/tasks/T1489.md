**Parent**: T1231
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor with mockall in backend/src/payment/stripe_processor.rs

## Reason for Delegation
The fractal_delegate failed to split the task due to internal constraints. Re-attempting with a simplified, single-file approach to ensure test coverage for StripeProcessor and its dependencies, starting with the core implementation and building test coverage incrementally.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
