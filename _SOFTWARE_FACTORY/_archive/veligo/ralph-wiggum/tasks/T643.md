# Task T643: Implement PaynumAdapter with common interface

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T623
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement PaynumAdapter with common interface

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of two payment adapters (Paynum + Stripe), factory pattern, and integration tests across multiple files, touching backend infrastructure and testing layers. This spans more than 5 files and involves HTTP clients, API integrations, and test mocking.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

Now let me see the existing PaymentPort trait and understand what the PaynumAdapter needs to implement:
</think>

<bash>
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/domain/payment/port.rs</bash>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
// Trace: Sprint 004 - 2025-12-11T12:46:10Z - Payment Port (Hexagonal Architecture)

use super::types::{Money, PaymentError, PaymentMethod, PaymentProvider, PaymentStatus};
use async_trait::async_trait;

/// Payment Port - Hexagonal Architecture Interface
///
/// This trait defines the contract that all payment adapters must implement.
/// It allows switching between different payment providers (Paynum, Stripe, Mock)
/// without changing domain or application logic.
///
/// Configuration per ten
```

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me see the full content of port.rs since it seems to be getting cut off. The file seems quite short.
</think>

<bash>
wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/domain/payment/port.rs</bash>
<bash>
cat -A veligo-platform/backend/src/domain/payment/port.rs</bash>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
