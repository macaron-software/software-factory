# Task T1115: Refactor PaymentAdapterFactory to use a testable factory pat

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1042
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Refactor PaymentAdapterFactory to use a testable factory pattern with trait-based dependencies

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

The file output seems truncated. Let me try to get the full content of these files one at a time.

The shell seems to be having issues. Let me try a simpler approach - maybe the bash tool has a different issue. Let me try with different quoting or approach.
