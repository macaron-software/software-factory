# Task T896: Verify tests pass with proper mocking and no stubs/TODOS

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T841
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify tests pass with proper mocking and no stubs/TODOS

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PaymentService and PaymentAdapterFactory across multiple files (likely 4+ files), touching payment logic, factory pattern, dependency injection, and test isolation. This exceeds 400 LOC and spans multiple domains, making it too complex for a single agent.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
