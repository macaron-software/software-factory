# Task T1200: Remove any stubs or TODOs in payment module

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1061
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Remove any stubs or TODOs in payment module

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend/src/payment with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation — involving StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files. Total estimated LOC exceeds 400, touching multiple domains and requiring mock injection and test isolation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

I found the issue! There's a stub at line 58-60 in `paypal_adapter.rs`:

```rust
async fn paypal_adapter() {
    // Stub implementation
    unimplemented!()
}
```

This looks like an incorrectly implemented method. It should probably be calling the processor's method or be removed entirely. Let me look at what methods the trait requires and what the processor does.
</think>

Found the stub! Let me check the trait requirements and the processor to understand what this method should do:
<bash>
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs
</bash>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
// Placeholder - will be replaced with actual content
