# Task T1019: Verify dependency injection is properly mocked and isolated 

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T878
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify dependency injection is properly mocked and isolated in tests

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory and its implementations across multiple files, touching 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains (payment logic, factory pattern, dependency injection, test isolation)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
