**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T2234
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Refactor existing repository tests to use consistent test patterns (setup, teardown, assertions, mocks)

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires consistent test patterns across 8 files across backend+tests with multiple repository implementations (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Mock), test fixtures, and integration testing across providers. Exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains (repository pattern, testing, integration, fixtures, provider abstraction).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
