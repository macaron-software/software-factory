# Task T1193: Verify test isolation by running tests in parallel and ensur

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1059
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify test isolation by running tests in parallel and ensuring no side effects between test cases

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit testing across 4+ files in backend/src/payment with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation — involving StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files. Total estimated LOC exceeds 400, touching multiple domains and requiring mock injection and test isolation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

The path might be wrong. Let me check the actual directory structure.
