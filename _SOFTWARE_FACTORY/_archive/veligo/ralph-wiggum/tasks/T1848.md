**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1782
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify all tests pass after refactoring

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires refactoring 8+ files across backend/src/payment module (400+ LOC), involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation with mocks. This exceeds complexity threshold and spans multiple domains (core service, config, trait, tests).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
