# Task T1097: Verify test coverage and isolate test dependencies using moc

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1038
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify test coverage and isolate test dependencies using mocks

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, and PaymentAdapterFactory across 4+ files with dependency injection, mocking, and test isolation. Involves complex interactions, factory pattern, and multiple domains. Estimated LOC >400, files >5.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
