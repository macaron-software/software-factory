**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1032
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Test StripeProcessor integration in PaymentAdapterFactory

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
