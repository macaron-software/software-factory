# Task T1783: Refactor StripeProcessor to accept dependencies via construc

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1359
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Refactor StripeProcessor to accept dependencies via constructor injection

## Reason for Delegation
Task involves updating StripeProcessor with injected dependencies across 8+ files (backend/src/payment), requiring dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation with mocks. This exceeds complexity threshold with >400 LOC and touches multiple domains (payment, testing, DI, factories).

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
