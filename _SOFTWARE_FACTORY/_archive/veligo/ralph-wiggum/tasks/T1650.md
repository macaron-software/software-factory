**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1499
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Ensure error types are consistent across factory and config modules

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires handling empty and invalid configurations in payment_factory.rs, which involves multiple files across backend (src/, tests/, etc.), complex dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 6 files with >400 LOC and multiple domains (config, error handling, factory, tests, etc.)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
