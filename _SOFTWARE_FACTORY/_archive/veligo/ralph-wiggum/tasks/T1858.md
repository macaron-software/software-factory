**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1797
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify correct instantiation and behavior of PaymentProcessor implementations in test environment

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration-style tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies across 4+ files (PaymentAdapterFactory, StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, and potentially PaymentProcessor trait), involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, likely exceeding 400 LOC and spanning multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
