# Task T1000: Ensure test isolation and dependency injection mocks using m

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T872
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Ensure test isolation and dependency injection mocks using mockall or similar in backend/src/payment/tests/

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with malformed input edge cases across multiple files (4+), touching backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains (payment logic, factory pattern, dependency injection, test isolation)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

```bash
pwd && find . -type f -name "*.rs" | grep -i payment | head -20</code>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me just try to explore the file system to understand the structure.
</think>

```bash
find . -type d -name "payment" 2>/dev/null | head -10</code>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The user is asking me to provide concrete actions. Let me try to find the payment-related files in the current directory structure.

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.rs" 2>/dev/null | head -30</code>
