# Task T1173: Verify test isolation by running tests in isolation and ensu

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1055
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify test isolation by running tests in isolation and ensuring no side effects

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires refactoring and verification of test isolation across 8 files in backend/src/payment, involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and multiple test suites. Touches StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files across 4+ files with >400 LOC and complex interactions.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Let me explore the payment module structure in more detail to understand the test isolation issues.
