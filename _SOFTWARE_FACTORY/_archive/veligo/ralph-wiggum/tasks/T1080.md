# Task T1080: Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor with dependency inj

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1034
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor with dependency injection mocks

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, and PaymentAdapterFactory across 4+ files with dependency injection and mocking, touching backend/src/payment directory and associated test files. Involves complex interactions, factory pattern, and mocking of dependencies across multiple domains. Estimated LOC >400, files >5.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
