# Task T1127: Create test fixtures and mocks for PaymentAdapter dependenci

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1044
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Create test fixtures and mocks for PaymentAdapter dependencies

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory across multiple files (PaymentAdapterFactory, StripeProcessor, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Let me continue exploring to find the PaymentAdapterFactory and StripeProcessor, and understand the test structure.

find veligo-platform/backend/src/payment -type f -name "*.rs" | xargs ls -la

<think>
Now I have a better understanding. Let me see the full adapter.rs file and the payment_factory_tests.rs to understand what tests exist and what needs to be mocked.
