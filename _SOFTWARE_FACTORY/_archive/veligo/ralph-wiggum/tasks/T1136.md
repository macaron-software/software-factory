# Task T1136: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/sr

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1045
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for StripeProcessor in backend/src/payment/stripe_processor.rs, which touches multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, test files) and involves complex interactions with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This spans 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

This is strange. The bash command is being mangled. Let me try a simpler approach.
</think>

<bash>
ls -la /root/veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/
</bash>


=== Action Results ===
bash: FAIL
/bin/sh: nls: command not found

<think>
This is strange - the bash commands are being parsed incorrectly. Let me try a simpler command without the newlines or XML-like structure.
</think>

<bash>
echo "test"
</bash>


=== Action Results ===
bash: FAIL
/bin/sh: necho: command not found
```
