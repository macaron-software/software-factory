## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor with proper mocking of dependencies

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with proper mocking of dependencies, touching multiple files across backend/src/payment (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory), and associated test files. This involves complex interactions with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation, likely exceeding 400 LOC and involving at least 6 files.
