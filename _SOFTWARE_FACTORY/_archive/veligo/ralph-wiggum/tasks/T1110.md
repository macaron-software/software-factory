# Task T1110: Implement unit tests for PaymentProcessor trait and its impl

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1040
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentProcessor trait and its implementations

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for StripeProcessor across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related components) with complex dependency injection and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Something is strange - the file seems to only contain partial content. Let me try a different approach to view the full file.

<bash>
ls -la veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapters/
file veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapters/stripe.rs
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapters/stripe.rs | wc -l</bash>
