## Description
Ensure 100% test coverage across all payment processor files using `cargo test --lib -- --test-threads=1` and `cargo coverage`

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires verifying test isolation and coverage across 4+ files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and their test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Involves multiple domains and exceeds 400 LOC across backend/src/payment directory and associated test files.
