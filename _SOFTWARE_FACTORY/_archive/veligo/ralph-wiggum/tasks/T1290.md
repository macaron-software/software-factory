# Task T1290: Create test fixtures module with PostgreSQL, Mock, and SQLit

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1268
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Create test fixtures module with PostgreSQL, Mock, and SQLite provider fixtures

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementing integration tests with isolated fixtures across multiple repository/provider implementations. This involves:
1. Understanding the existing repository pattern in the codebase
2. Creating test fixtures for PostgreSQL (test containers), Mock, and potentially SQLite
3. Writing comprehensive integration tests for bike CRUD operations
4. Ensuring test isolation between providers
5. Multiple files needed: test file, fixtures module, utilities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

Let me get the full content of the files to understand the codebase better. I need to see the full repository.rs and other files.

<bash>
cat -A veligo-platform/backend/src/bike.rs | tail -100
