# Task T1045: Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor in backend/src/paym

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1027
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor in backend/src/payment/stripe_processor.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory across multiple files (PaymentAdapterFactory, StripeProcessor, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
It seems like there's no `stripe_processor.rs` file yet in the backend. The task asks me to implement unit tests for StripeProcessor in `backend/src/payment/stripe_processor.rs`, but this file doesn't exist. 

Looking at the context:
1. There's a `StripeAdapter` in `adapters/stripe.rs`
2. There's a `PaypalProcessor` in `payment/paypal_processor.rs`

So I need to:
1. First check if `stripe_processor.rs` exists or if I need to create it
2. Looking at the paypal_processor.rs pattern, there should be a StripeProcessor

Let me check the full paypal_processor.rs to understand the pattern, then check if stripe_processor.rs exists.
</think>

I see there's no `stripe_processor.rs` yet. Let me check the full paypal_processor.rs to understand the pattern, and then check what exists:
<bash>
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/paypal_processor.rs
```
```
