# Task T1112: Implement integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with m

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1042
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies in backend/src/payment/tests/mod.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Now let me check the existing tests folder structure and see if there's a tests directory:
</think>

```bash
ls -la veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/tests/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No tests directory found"
```

<invoke><file_existence>
veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/tests/</file_existence>
</invoke></invoke>

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
No tests directory found
```

## Last Failure (Wed Jan 14 20:26:23 CET 2026)
```
The file was truncated. Let me read the full adapter.rs file to understand the PaymentAdapterFactory implementation.
</think>

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs | head -200
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK

use std::collections::HashMap;
use crate::payment::{
    PaymentAdapter as PaymentAdapterTrait, PaymentError, PaymentProvider, PaymentRequest,
    PaymentResponse, PaymentResult, PaymentStatus, RefundRequest, RefundResponse,
};
use super::{PayPalProcessor, PayPalProcessorConfig, StripeProcessor, StripeProcessorConfig};
