Verify StripeProcessor and PayPalProcessor integration with mock payment gateways

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of integration tests for PaymentProcessor factory pattern across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory), involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This spans 5+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, with complex interactions and test isolation requirements. Exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains (payment processing, factory pattern, testing).
