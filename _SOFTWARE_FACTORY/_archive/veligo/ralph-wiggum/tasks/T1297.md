# Task T1297: Verify test isolation and dependency injection in unit tests

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1287
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify test isolation and dependency injection in unit tests

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend+tests with dependency injection and test isolation. Involves complex interactions, factory pattern, and mocking of dependencies across multiple domains. Estimated LOC >400, files >5.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

```

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/domains/bike/service_test.rs
```

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/domains/user/service_test.rs
```

All files have been created with comprehensive test implementations. The tests demonstrate:

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test uses its own `InMemoryRepository` instance - no shared state
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are constructed with `Arc<InMemoryRepository>` 
3. **Factory Pattern**: Helper functions `create_test_bike()` and `create_test_user()` create test fixtures
4. **Complete Coverage**: Tests for create, find, update, and delete operations with success and error cases

```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | grep -E "test result|running|passed"
```
```
