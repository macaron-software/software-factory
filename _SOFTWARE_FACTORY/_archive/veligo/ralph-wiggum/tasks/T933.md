**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PayPalProcessor with similar mocking and isolation

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for StripeProcessor across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Involves 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, likely exceeding 400 LOC and touching multiple domains. Complex interactions require isolated testing with mocks and proper setup.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
