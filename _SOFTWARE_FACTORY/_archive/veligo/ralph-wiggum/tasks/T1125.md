# Task T1125: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/sr

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1044
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory across multiple files (PaymentAdapterFactory, StripeProcessor, and related test files) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Now I found the payment module. Let me read the main files to understand the structure and implement tests.

<think>
Let me try a different approach to read the file completely.
</think>

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' ./veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs
```

=== Action Results ===
bash: OK
// Current implementation
```
