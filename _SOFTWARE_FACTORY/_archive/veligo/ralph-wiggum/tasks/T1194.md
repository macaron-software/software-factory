# Task T1194: Implement StripeProcessor with mockable dependencies

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1061
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement StripeProcessor with mockable dependencies

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires 8 files across backend/src/payment with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation — involving StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files. Total estimated LOC exceeds 400, touching multiple domains and requiring mock injection and test isolation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
The bash commands are working but getting truncated. Let me try a different approach - reading the entire file in a more structured way. Let me first check if there are existing test files and understand the structure better.
