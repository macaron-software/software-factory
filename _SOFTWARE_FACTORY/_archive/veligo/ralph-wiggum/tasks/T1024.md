# Task T1024: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T844
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

Let me check the structure more carefully. It seems there's a nested adapters directory. Let me look at the full structure.

Let me check the adapters directory structure:
<tool_code>
find_and_cat
<path>veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapters</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</tool_code>
```

        let adapter = factory.create_adapter(PaymentProvider::Paynum, "pk_test_123".to_string());
     

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Now I have a good picture of the codebase. Let me look at the full payment.rs file and also check if there's an existing test file to understand what's already been done.

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment.rs | wc -l
```

bash: OK
