# Task T1291: Write comprehensive integration tests for BikeRepository ope

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1268
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Write comprehensive integration tests for BikeRepository operations

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementing integration tests with isolated fixtures across multiple repository/provider implementations. This involves:
1. Understanding the existing repository pattern in the codebase
2. Creating test fixtures for PostgreSQL (test containers), Mock, and potentially SQLite
3. Writing comprehensive integration tests for bike CRUD operations
4. Ensuring test isolation between providers
5. Multiple files needed: test file, fixtures module, utilities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

//! Repository trait for bike data access.
//! 
//! This module defines the `BikeRepository` trait which enables dependency injection
//! and allows for mocking in tests. All data access operations are abstracted behind
//! this trait, making it easy to swap between real and mock implementations.
