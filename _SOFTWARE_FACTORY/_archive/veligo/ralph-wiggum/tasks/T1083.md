# Task T1083: Verify all tests pass with cargo test --lib

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1034
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Verify all tests pass with cargo test --lib

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, and PaymentAdapterFactory across 4+ files with dependency injection and mocking, touching backend/src/payment directory and associated test files. Involves complex interactions, factory pattern, and mocking of dependencies across multiple domains. Estimated LOC >400, files >5.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
I found the payment files. Now let me explore them to understand the structure and then run the tests. The task mentions PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, and PaymentAdapterFactory. Let me check the payment module files.
