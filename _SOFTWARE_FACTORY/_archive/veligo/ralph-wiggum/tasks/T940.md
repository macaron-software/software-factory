# Task T940: Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T854
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for StripeProcessor

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementation of unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory and its dependencies (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor), involving multiple files across backend/src/payment directory (likely 4+ files), complex interactions with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. This exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains, requiring coordinated test implementation across multiple components.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
