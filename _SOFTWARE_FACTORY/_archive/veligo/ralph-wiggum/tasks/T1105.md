# Task T1105: Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/sr

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1039
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentAdapterFactory in backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit tests for PayPalProcessor across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with complex interactions involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
Now I can see the file structure. The file I need is `backend/src/payment/adapter_factory.rs` (not `payment_adapter_factory.rs`). Let me read that file along with related files to understand the implementation.

Now I can see the structure. The factory is in `adapter_factory.rs`. Let me read the relevant files:
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/adapter_factory.rs</bash_command>
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/mod.rs</bash_command>
<bash_command>
cat backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash_command>
