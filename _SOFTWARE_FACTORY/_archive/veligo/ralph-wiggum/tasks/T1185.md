# Task T1185: Create mock implementations for PaymentProcessor interfaces 

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1058
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Create mock implementations for PaymentProcessor interfaces used in PaymentAdapterFactory

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit testing across 4+ files in backend/src/payment with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation — involving StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files. Total estimated LOC exceeds 400, touching multiple domains and requiring mock injection and test isolation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The bash commands are failing. Let me try a different approach and just write the files directly based on the task description. The task is to create mock implementations for PaymentProcessor interfaces used in PaymentAdapterFactory. I need to:

1. Create mock implementations for the PaymentProcessor trait/interface
2. These mocks should be used in tests for PaymentAdapterFactory

Let me look at the existing files first by trying to read them.

<think>
The bash commands are failing. Let me try a different approach - I'll use <write> tags to create the file directly. First, let me check if I can read the mod.rs file to understand the structure.
