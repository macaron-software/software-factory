## Description
Verify all tests pass with no stubs or TODOs

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires implementing test isolation across multiple payment processor files (StripeProcessor, PayPalProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) with test fixtures and mocking frameworks. This involves 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory, test setup, dependency injection patterns, and mocking complex interactions. Likely exceeds 400 LOC and touches multiple domains (payment logic, factory pattern, test isolation).
