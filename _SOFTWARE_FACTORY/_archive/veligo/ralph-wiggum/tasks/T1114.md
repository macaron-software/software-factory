# Task T1114: Update PaymentAdapterFactory to support dependency injection

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1042
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Update PaymentAdapterFactory to support dependency injection via trait objects for testing

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires integration tests for PaymentAdapterFactory with mock dependencies across multiple files (PayPalProcessor, StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory) involving dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
The output is getting truncated. Let me try a different approach to get the full file.

<bash>
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs | head -300</bash>

```bash
head -500 veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The cat/head commands are timing out. Let me try a different approach - maybe the file is large and taking time. Let me try tail instead.
</think>

```bash
wc -l veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs && tail -100 veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter.rs</bash>

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
The terminal is having issues. Let me try a simpler approach to read the files.
</think>

```bash
cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/payment_adapter_factory.rs</bash>
```
