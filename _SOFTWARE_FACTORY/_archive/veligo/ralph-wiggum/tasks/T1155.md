# Task T1155: Create mock dependencies and test fixtures for StripeProcess

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1052
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Create mock dependencies and test fixtures for StripeProcessor test suite

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires test isolation and proper dependency injection across multiple files (StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files), involving complex interactions, factory pattern, and dependency injection. Touches 4+ files in backend/src/payment directory and associated test files, exceeding 400 LOC and involving multiple domains.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

<think>
The files seem to have placeholder content. Let me look at the tests to understand what needs to be mocked.
