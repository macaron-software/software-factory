**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Ensure integration tests run against all three providers with isolated state

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires ensuring test isolation across PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Mock database providers, involving 8 files across backend and tests, multiple repository implementations, test fixtures, and integration testing. This exceeds 400 LOC and spans multiple domains (database, testing, fixtures, providers), making it too complex for a single agent.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs
