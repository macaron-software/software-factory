# Task T1183: Implement unit tests for PaymentService with dependency inje

**Priority**: P1
**WSJF Score**: 8.0
**Queue**: TDD
**Parent**: T1057
**Generated by**: Fractal LLM Delegation

## Description
Implement unit tests for PaymentService with dependency injection and mocking

## Reason for Delegation
Task requires unit testing across 4+ files in backend/src/payment with dependency injection, factory pattern, and test isolation — involving StripeProcessor, PaymentAdapterFactory, and related test files. Total estimated LOC exceeds 400, touching multiple domains and requiring mock injection and test isolation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No stubs or TODOs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me check the adapter directory structure more carefully. It seems like the adapter module is a directory, but the actual adapter.rs file is in the parent payment directory. Let me explore more.

cat veligo-platform/backend/src/payment/adapter/factory.rs

=== LLM Response ===
<think>
Let me explore more of the file structure. I need to find where PaymentService is defined and understand the test structure better.
