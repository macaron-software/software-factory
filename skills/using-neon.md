# Neon Serverless Postgres

Neon is a serverless Postgres platform that separates compute and storage to offer autoscaling, branching, instant restore, and scale-to-zero. It's fully compatible with Postgres and works with any language, framework, or ORM that supports Postgres.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Working with Neon Serverless Postgres
- Setting up Neon databases
- Choosing connection methods for Neon
- Using Neon features like branching or autoscaling
- Working with Neon authentication or APIs
- Questions about Neon best practices

## Neon Documentation

Always reference the Neon documentation before making Neon-related claims. The documentation is the source of truth for all Neon-related information.

Below you'll find a list of resources organized by area of concern. This is meant to support you find the right documentation pages to fetch and add a bit of additonal context.

You can use the `curl` commands to fetch the documentation page as markdown:

**Documentation:**

```bash
# Get list of all Neon docs
curl https://neon.com/llms.txt

# Fetch any doc page as markdown
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://neon.com/docs/<path>
```

Don't guess docs pages. Use the `llms.txt` index to find the relevant URL or follow the links in the resources below.
